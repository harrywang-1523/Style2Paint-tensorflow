# style2paint-tensorflow

This repo aims to implement the code in *Style Transfer for Anime Sketches*
*with Enhanced Residual U-net and Auxiliary Classifier GAN* [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03319) using keras.

This repo is still **under development** for now. Updating will be made soon.

This model uses the VGG code in this [repo](https://github.com/fchollet/deep-learning-models).
